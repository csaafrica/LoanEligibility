# LoanLens
 **Problem Context**\
A Housing Finance company is aiming to automate their Loan Eligibility Process.\
They want to identify customer segments likely to be eligible for home loans based on their application details.\
Currently, the loan approval process is manual, time-consuming, and often based on subjective judgment.\

This can lead to:\
Inconsistent decisions\
Delays in processing\
Missed opportunities to approve qualified applicants quickly\

**This solution will:**\
Reduce the manual workload of staff
Improve loan processing speed and efficiency
Make data-driven decisions for better risk assessment


**Project Objective**
